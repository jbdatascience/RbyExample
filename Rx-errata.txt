If murder.pct was created previously (as in the example using attach)
then it will remain as a global variable. To see what happens using
with(), try removing murder.pct:

 > rm(murder.pct)
 > with(USArrests, expr={
 +     murder.pct = 100 * Murder / (Murder + Assault + Rape)
 +     })
 > murder.pct
 Error: object 'murder.pct' not found
